          My name is Adam Carpenter and I am a creative problem-solver dedicated to producing clean, modular, testable code. With an insatiable appetite for knowledge, I strive to encourage communication, creativity, and critical thinking in those who surround me.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          After 10 years of working as a traveling musician and a few years in the telecommunications industry I became a software developer.  As such, I get to merge my passion for creativity, technology and problem solving into a sustainable career in a progressive industry.  I have a passion for creating websites and applications that are intuitive, accessible and generally make peoples lives a little easier.
